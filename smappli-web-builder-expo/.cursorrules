# Cursor Rules for Smappli Web Builder Expo

## Project Context
This is a React Native Expo web builder project for creating mobile app layouts. 
Working directory: smappli-web-builder-expo/

## File Structure Rules
- All code files should be created within smappli-web-builder-expo/ directory
- Do NOT create files outside this directory
- Do NOT modify mobile app files in parent directories
- Focus only on web builder functionality

## Technology Stack
- React Native Expo (for web compatibility)
- TypeScript
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Expo Web for browser rendering

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)

- Each block has: id, type, content, style properties
- Button blocks have title and buttons array
- Gallery blocks support different image shapes

## Development Focus
- Web-based drag & drop interface
- Real-time preview
- Component property editing
- WebSocket communication with mobile app
